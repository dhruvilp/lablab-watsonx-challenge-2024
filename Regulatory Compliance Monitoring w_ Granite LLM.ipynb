Since publication of the February 2024 Alert, Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of State have collectively designated 13 individuals and entities6 under Executive Order (E.O.) 14115, which authorizes the U.S. government to impose financial sanctions on foreign persons that, inter alia, are responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in (1) actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or (2) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in specified actions affecting the West Bank, such as violence targeting civilians and property destruction.7 OFAC reminds individuals and financial institutions that all U.S. persons, which generally include any person in the United States, any entity organized under U.S. law, and any U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident anywhere in the world, are generally prohibited from making any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any individual or entity designated under E.O. 14115 and any entities owned 50 percent or more by such designated individuals or entities.8 This includes engaging in crowdfunding activities that are used to raise funds internationally in support of designated violent extremist Israeli settlers, as well as other fundraising undertaken on behalf of such designated persons.9 Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions, such as prohibitions on causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions. Violations of U.S. sanctions may result in civil or criminal penalties,10 and persons who materially support any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14115 may themselves be sanctioned. FinCEN is providing additional red flag indicators of suspicious activity potentially related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including flags derived from open-source reporting. All red flag indicators highlighted in the February 2024 Alert remain valid,11 and FinCEN has identified the following additional red flag indicators to help financial institutions detect, prevent, and report potential suspicious activity related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank: Payments involving entities, individuals, addresses on accounts, receiving addresses, or IP addresses linked to any West Bank \u201coutpost.\u201d12 References or payments to accounts held in the name of Israeli violent extremist settler groups or individuals involved or implicated in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including references or payments to accounts held by known immediate family members of designated individuals. The West Bank region may also be referred to as \u201cJudea and Samaria,\u201d \u201cShomron,\u201d \u201cYehuda,\u201d or \u201cYehuda v\u2019Shomoron\u201d by supporters of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.13 References or payments to accounts or webpages that are fundraising for convicted, imprisoned, or U.S.-sanctioned violent extremists who targeted Palestinians in the West Bank. Accounts that share a merchant representative, email, phone number, social media page, or physical address with accounts held in the name of designated individuals or entities. Payments to beneficiaries, accounts, or crowdfunding campaigns linked to social media indicating support for violence in the West Bank, including pictures and videos, support for violence targeting Palestinians in the West Bank, or references to known or designated Israeli settler violent extremists, outposts, herding farms, or groups. Crowdfunding campaigns and social media may include phrases like \u201cState Land,\u201d \u201cArea C,\u201d \u201cpreserving State Land,\u201d \u201cHilltop Youth,\u201d \u201cYouth of the Hills,\u201d or \u201cstopping supply convoys.\u201d FinCEN reminds financial institutions that, as no single red flag is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances before determining whether a specific transaction is suspicious or associated with potential Israeli extremist settler violence.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"FIN-2024-Alert001\",\n            \"date\": \"2024-02-01\",\n            \"description\": \"FinCEN Issues Alert on Israeli Extremist Settler Violence Against Palestinians in the West Bank\",\n            \"alert_message\": \"FinCEN Alert on Israeli Extremist Settler Violence Against Palestinians in the West Bank The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is issuing this alert to financial institutions1 related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.

The United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including attacks by Israeli violent extremist settlers against Palestinians, attacks by Palestinian violent extremists against Israelis, and other acts that unduly restrict civilians\u2019 access to essential services and basic necessities and risk further escalating tensions and expanding the conflict in the region.2 As the U.S. Department of State (State) noted, the U.S. Government \u201cwill continue to seek accountability and justice for all acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank, regardless of the perpetrator or the victim.\u201d3 Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) additionally is highlighting for members of the public that the President, on February 1, 2024, issued an Executive Order (E.O.) that authorizes the U.S. government to impose sanctions on foreign persons that are responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in (1) actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or (2) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in specified actions affecting the West Bank, such as violence targeting civilians and property destruction.4 The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those engaged in such activities, as well as to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse FinCEN has identified the following red flag indicators to help detect, prevent, and report potential suspicious activity related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. As no single red flag is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances before determining whether a specific transaction is suspicious or associated with potential Israeli extremist settler violence: Payments to any organizations or groups, including nonprofit organizations (NPO),5 that are now or have been previously linked to violent extremist groups in the West Bank or lists an officer, founder, or director that is currently or has been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank. Information included in a transaction between customers, such as references in the memo field, that indicate support for Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Transactions with no apparent economic, business, or lawful purpose associated with a rapid movement of funds and linked to NPOs active in supporting violent extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank, particularly if the NPO has advocated for, or solicited donations on social media in support of, Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Purchases of tactical military gear for resale overseas and destined for non-government Israeli end-users in the West Bank, particularly if the end-users are currently or have been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank. FinCEN requests that financial institutions reference this alert by including the key term \u201cFIN-2024- WBEXTREMISM\u201d in SAR field 2 (Filing Institutions Note to FinCEN) and the narrative to indicate a connection between the suspicious activity being reported and this alert.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"FIN-2024-Alert003\",\n            \"date\": \"2024-08-15\",\n            \"description\": \"FinCEN Alert on Emerging Trends in Human Trafficking Financing\",\n            \"alert_message\": \"FinCEN has issued an alert to financial institutions regarding new trends in the financing of human trafficking operations.

It is essential for our organization to stay up-to-date with these updates to ensure we are meeting our regulatory obligations.\n\nReview of FinCEN Alerts and Advisories:\n\nWe have reviewed the latest FinCEN alerts and advisories, including the following:\n\n* FinCEN Alert FIN-2022-A005: \"Advisory on Human Trafficking and Smuggling of Persons\"\n* FinCEN Alert FIN-2022-A006: \"Advisory on the Use of the U.S. Financial System by Entities Sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control\"\n* FinCEN Advisory FIN-2022-A007: \"Advisory on the Risks and Vulnerabilities of Money Services Businesses\"\n\nKey Findings:\n\nOur review of the alerts and advisories highlighted several areas of concern and key findings, including:\n\n* Increased risk of human trafficking and smuggling of persons in the United States, particularly in the hospitality and transportation sectors.\n* The use of the U.S. financial system by entities sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) continues to be a significant concern, with new sanctions imposed on several countries and entities.\n* Money services businesses (MSBs) remain vulnerable to money laundering and other financial crimes, particularly those operating in jurisdictions with weak AML/CFT controls.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBased on our review of the FinCEN alerts and advisories, we recommend the following actions to ensure compliance with current AML regulations:\n\n* Conduct enhanced due diligence on customers in the hospitality and transportation sectors, particularly those with international connections or transactions.\n* Implement updated OFAC sanctions screening procedures to ensure that our organization is not doing business with sanctioned entities.\n* Enhance monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity related to MSBs, particularly those operating in high-risk jurisdictions.\n* Provide additional training to employees on the risks and vulnerabilities associated with human trafficking and smuggling of persons, as well as the updated OFAC sanctions.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur review of the latest FinCEN alerts and advisories highlights the importance of staying up-to-date with current AML regulations and the need for ongoing vigilance in identifying and reporting suspicious activity.

Since publication of the February 2024 Alert, Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of State have collectively designated 13 individuals and entities6 under Executive Order (E.O.) 14115, which authorizes the U.S. government to impose financial sanctions on foreign persons that, inter alia, are responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in (1) actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or (2) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in specified actions affecting the West Bank, such as violence targeting civilians and property destruction.7 OFAC reminds individuals and financial institutions that all U.S. persons, which generally include any person in the United States, any entity organized under U.S. law, and any U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident anywhere in the world, are generally prohibited from making any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any individual or entity designated under E.O. 14115 and any entities owned 50 percent or more by such designated individuals or entities.8 This includes engaging in crowdfunding activities that are used to raise funds internationally in support of designated violent extremist Israeli settlers, as well as other fundraising undertaken on behalf of such designated persons.9 Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions, such as prohibitions on causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions. Violations of U.S. sanctions may result in civil or criminal penalties,10 and persons who materially support any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14115 may themselves be sanctioned. FinCEN is providing additional red flag indicators of suspicious activity potentially related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including flags derived from open-source reporting. All red flag indicators highlighted in the February 2024 Alert remain valid,11 and FinCEN has identified the following additional red flag indicators to help financial institutions detect, prevent, and report potential suspicious activity related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank: Payments involving entities, individuals, addresses on accounts, receiving addresses, or IP addresses linked to any West Bank \u201coutpost.\u201d12 References or payments to accounts held in the name of Israeli violent extremist settler groups or individuals involved or implicated in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including references or payments to accounts held by known immediate family members of designated individuals.

Accounts that share a merchant representative, email, phone number, social media page, or physical address with accounts held in the name of designated individuals or entities. Payments to beneficiaries, accounts, or crowdfunding campaigns linked to social media indicating support for violence in the West Bank, including pictures and videos, support for violence targeting Palestinians in the West Bank, or references to known or designated Israeli settler violent extremists, outposts, herding farms, or groups.

As no single red flag is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances before determining whether a specific transaction is suspicious or associated with potential Israeli extremist settler violence: Payments to any organizations or groups, including nonprofit organizations (NPO),5 that are now or have been previously linked to violent extremist groups in the West Bank or lists an officer, founder, or director that is currently or has been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank. Information included in a transaction between customers, such as references in the memo field, that indicate support for Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Transactions with no apparent economic, business, or lawful purpose associated with a rapid movement of funds and linked to NPOs active in supporting violent extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank, particularly if the NPO has advocated for, or solicited donations on social media in support of, Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Purchases of tactical military gear for resale overseas and destined for non-government Israeli end-users in the West Bank, particularly if the end-users are currently or have been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank.
